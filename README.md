## Study Plan for Robotics <a name="StudyPlan"></a>
The Robotics Master's has 120 credits, including 2 (or 3) 10-credit Semester Projects, an uncredited internship and a 30-credit Master's Project (which can be done in industry also).

My plan upto present
- MA1: 33 credits
- MA2: 28 credits, incl. Semester Project

## My Courses <a name="Courses"></a>
My main interests are in Image Processing and Embedded Systems!

### Core Courses <a name="Core"></a>

| Course         | Credits | Workload | Difficulty | Comments |
|----------------|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| Applied Machine Learning | 4       | Light    | Hard       | Fully recorded remote course. Way too theory-oriented to be enjoyable, not very "applied". Exam is needlessly cruel|
| Basics of Mobile Robotics    | 4       | Fair    | Easy       | A much easier version of the Robotics BA course. The project is in RANDOM groups of 5, so your mileage may vary. Exam is exactly like the Case Studies. Course material stays relatively basic.|
| Basics of Robotics for Manipulation    | 3       | Very Light    | Easy       | Highly disorganised course. The exam is very formulaic and always the same, so train. Course material is not difficult, the slides can be enough. |
| Robotics Practicals    | 2       | Light    | Easy      | Very bad organisation. Choose your practicals wisely, some are very easy and quick, some are horribly long and hard. You won't learn much most likely. |
| **SHS:** Mythes de la Méditerrannée   | 6       | Very Light    | Easy       | FRENCH ONLY: Profs tres sympa, presence seulement quelques seances sur l'annee. Soyez creatifs et osez faire les clowns et vous aurez la belle note.|

| Advanced Control Systems | 3       | Fair    | Hard       | It's a Karimi course: NOT easy, but you really learn a lot! CEs are well designed and helpful, not enough TAs unfortunately. Exam was NOT easy, but not BS either. It can be very discouraging at times, since the Prof. tends to say "If you don't know X, you shouldn't be taking this course".| Only if you LOVE Control  |
| Applied Data Analysis | 8       | High    | Not Easy    | Super foundational course in Data Analysis. If you want to have hands-on experience, this is where you go. Be aware, this is an **8 credit course** with only 4 hours of course/exercise per week, **you have to work on your own a LOT**.  Great structure for the course, but these are not free credits! This will take over your timetable. | YES  |
| Embedded System Design | 6       | High    | Tough    | Want to program an FPGA-CPU and work on hyper-optimizing an application? This is the course. The Prof. expects you to know Verilog when coming in, and the labs are NOT EASY - the Project is perfectly fair however. This course was first given in 2024, so it might change still, but you will learn SO MUCH by taking this, if you love lower-than-low level programming. | Only if you like low-level  |
| Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition | 4       | Fair    | Easy    | Probably the most fun course I've taken at EPFL. Funny and charismatic prof with a very easy exam. The Labs are not hard to do, but the project is not easy, and will take up some valuable W12-W13 time to finish. You leave this course having learned a lot about classical Image Analysis methods, and you'll need to do some ML for the final project!         | YES  |
| Image Processing I | 3       | Light    | Easy    | Basically Signals and Systems III - with all their pros and cons. Very easy to follow remotely, and the labs are easy. I found this very interesting, but it tends to stay theoretical in material         | YES  |
| Machine Learning Programming | 2       | High    | BS    | The assignements involve you programming the algorithms behind each method taught in the Applied Machine Learning course, in MATLAB. You don't really learn much, but it helps with AML. It's very tedious, and the exam is BS: 3 super short questions to solve, accounting for 25% of the grade. Don't take this course if you want to actually apply ML knowledge - or don't take it at all.         | NO  |
| System Programming for Systems-on-chip | 6       | Fair    | Tough    | Much the same as Embedded System Design: Low-level C programming course, oriented towards Embedded Systems. 3 Labs to hand in, and they're not always easy. The end of semester exam was fair. Overall very fun to work on some real bare-metal C programming.       | If you enjoy Low Level Prog  |


## My Projects <a name="Projects"></a>

### Semester Project 1

I did my first Semester Project at DDMAC, with Prof. Karimi, my TA was Vaibhav Gupta. It was a project in control, very much retracing the things taught in Advanced Control Systems. 

- The TA was helpful, but busy, a high degree of independence was expected
- Prof. was absent, not overly strict in grading.
- Work was simulation*
- Mainly worked in the lab, but could've been almost fully remote

My project was a bit of a special case, as it was supposed to be a more hardware-oriented project, but I had to re-orient it to more theory/simulation since the real-time system wasn't working. Overall, it was a bit more work than it was worth, and the results weren't super satisfying, but the lab atmosphere in the Control Lab is really cool, and the TAs were happy to help whenever they could! In what I've seen, DDMAC is where you go for more theoretical Control Projects, Ferrari-Trecate or Jones might be better if you want to apply things (you can never guarantee success in a project, keep this in mind)!

## Other Activities <a name="Other"></a>
Was at EPFL Xplore during my MA2, which was fun! But starting W9, I didn't really have the time to work as much as I should have. Beware the MA2 end of semester crunch, I guess!

I did many Student Assistant jobs for Bachelor's courses:

- Microfabrication Technologies: Wrote the Jupyter Notebook exercises. Was fun work, but I don't think more than 5 people bothered to do them!
- Ingenierie Optique: Prof. Martin was looking for extra assistants, but it was super light work, as very few students actually bothered coming to the sessions. 
- Automatique et Commande Numerique: This is actually how I got in contact with Vaibhav for the Semester Project, and it's not easy explaining control!
- Microcontroleurs (SEL): Pretty much the worst money/effort ratio SA job at EPFL, as you're expected to grade the weekly labs, supervise and grade the exam, and grade the project. It's not an easy course either, and many students don't really know where to start with the project. Wasn't my first time doing this, and Prof. Schmid keeps recruiting more and more assistants each year, making the job easier and more worthwhile.
- Systemes Embarques et Robotique: Well paid! But 5 consecutive, intense hours of work aren't easy! It was a lot of fun, especially during the projects, but so much work!
